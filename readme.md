Some basic arithmetic operators are 
- '+'
- '-' 
- '*'
- '/' 
- %. 

In this challenge you will be given three parameters, num1, num2, and an operator. 
Use the operator on parameters num1 and num2.

**- There will be no division by zero.**

                                        Ex2.
Write a function that stutters a word as if someone is struggling to read it. 
The first two letters are repeated twice with an ellipsis ... and space after each, 
and then the word is pronounced with a question mark ?.

**- Assume all inputs are in lower case and at least two-character long.**


                                        Ex3.
Create a method that accepts a string (of a person's first and last name) and returns a string with the first and last name swapped.

**-There will be exactly one space between the first and last name.**


                                        Ex4.
Write a function that returns true if two rooks can attack each other, and false otherwise.

**- Assume no blocking pieces.**

**- Two rooks can attack each other if they share the same row (letter) or column (number).**

                                        Ex5.
Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns "Fizz", "Buzz" or "FizzBuzz".

- If the number is a multiple of 3 the output should be "Fizz".
- If the number given is a multiple of 5, the output should be "Buzz".
- If the number given is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the output should be "FizzBuzz".
- If the number is not a multiple of either 3 or 5, the number should be output on its own as shown in the examples below.
- The output should always be a string even if it is not a multiple of 3 or 5.

**- Try to be precise with how you spell things and where you put the capital letters.**

                                        Ex6.
Given a total due and an array representing the amount of change in your pocket, determine whether you are able to pay for the item. 
Change will always be represented in the following order: quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies.

**Ex: changeEnough([25, 20, 5, 0], 4.25) should yield true, since having 25 quarters, 20 dimes, 5 nickels and 0 pennies gives you 6.25 + 2 + .25 + 0 = 8.50.**

**- quarter: 25 cents / $0.25**

**- dime: 10 cents / $0.10**

**- nickel: 5 cents / $0.05**

**- penny: 1 cent / $0.01**

                                        Ex7.

Create a function that takes an array and returns the difference between the biggest and smallest numbers.

                                        Ex8.

Create a function that takes three integer arguments (a, b, c) and returns the amount of integers which are of equal value.

**Function must return 0, 2 or 3.**

                                        Ex9.

Create a method that takes a string as its argument and returns the string in reversed order.

                                        Ex10.

A word has been split into a left part and a right part. Re-form the word by adding both halves together, changing the first character to an uppercase letter.

                                        Ex11.

You hired three programmers and you (hopefully) pay them. 
Create a function that takes three numbers (the hourly wages of each programmer) and returns the difference between the highest-paid programmer and the lowest-paid.

                                        Ex12.

Create a method that takes an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9) and returns a string of those numbers formatted as a phone number 
**(e.g. (555) 555-5555)**.

                                        Ex13.

                                        Ex14.

Create a function that takes a string and returns the number (count) of vowels contained within it.

**- a, e, i, o, u are considered vowels (not y).**

**All test cases are one word and only contain letters.**

                                        Ex15.

                                        Ex16.
Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments *(num, length)* and returns an array of multiples of num until the array length reaches length.

**Notice that num is also included in the returned array.**
